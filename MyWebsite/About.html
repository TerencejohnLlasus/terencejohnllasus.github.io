    <p>Hello, everyone! My name is Terence John Llasus, and I'm a first-year college student pursuing a degree in Bachelor of Science in Information technology . I'm passionate about Coding and always eager to learn new things.</p>
    <p>During my college journey, I hope to expand my knowledge, develop valuable skills, and make lasting connections with fellow students and professors. I'm excited about the opportunities and challenges that college life has to offer.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching tutorials on How to Code. It helps me relax and recharge. I also love exploring new places, trying different cuisines, and spending quality time with my friends and family.</p>
    <p>I believe that college is not just about academics but also about personal growth and self-discovery. I'm looking forward to embracing all the experiences that come my way and making the most out of my college years.</p>
    <p>Feel free to connect with me and join me on this exciting journey!</p>
